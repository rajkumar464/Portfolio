# [Project 1 : Music-Classifier](https://github.com/rajkumar464/Music-Classifier)
* Built a Python web application to classify user-provided input song into 1 of 10 genres and also perform source separation into vocals, bass, drums and accompaniments for music producers, educators and streaming platforms' classification systems. </br>
* Fabricated an ensemble Random Forest Classifier model and trained it on 1000 different songs (100 per genre) and performed better than current methods based on waveform analysis with an accuracy of 70%.</br>
* Created 4 CNN masking models to predict binary masks for isolating each element i.e. vocals, bass, percussion and accompaniments, with the bass masking model achieving an accuracy of 96.3%.</br>
